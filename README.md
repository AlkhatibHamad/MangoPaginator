# MangoPaginator
MangoPaginator is a data pagination class. Often times when you display a large result set on a web page (such as a database query), you will want to break it up across multiple pages with "previous" and "next" links that aid in navigating through the data. MangoPaginator automates the task of keeping track of the pagination and displaying pagination navigation links.
